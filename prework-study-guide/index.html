        <ul><li>The head element contains information about the webpage. The user will not be able to see this information.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. </li>
          <li>Section elements are contained within the body element and can be organized with h1-h6, ul and li elements.</li>
          <li>H1 stands for Header 1, which will be the largest. Two and beyond are smaller headers.</li>
          <li>ul stands for unordered list, meaning meaning that the bullet points will not be numbered.</li>
          <li>li stands for List Item, which is the information that will be in each bullet.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want aroudn the content inside an element.
          <li>There are 3 different types of CSS, inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is when the developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheets are embeded directly in the HTMLL file using a style element in the head element. This sheet contains CSS rules that apply only to that page and can sthle multiple elements on that page.</li>
          <li>External style sheets are the most common and allow for the most flexibility. It is a separate file that is connected to the HTML by way of a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Storing a group of related data in a variable is called an array.</li>
          <li>The most efficent way to log multiple array values is by using for loops.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
